* [Forum topic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1397908-152-reimonkey/) at Minecraft Forums  
* [Original mod](http://minecraftmonkey.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/reimonkey/) at minecraftmonkey

ReiMonkey requires at least ModLoader for 1.6.2 and was built on Minecraft Forge 9.10.0.789 and Forge Mod Loader
v6.2.19.789 with MCP 8.04. ReiMonkey is a stand-alone mod and does not require Rei's Minimap to use, although it
will not function in any useful way.
